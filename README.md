## About

This is the first version of the pomodoro I am trying to create. I decided to use SASS with react to practice using it on my apps.

## Features

- can set the time for pomodoro, short break and long break
- when timer reaches zero, switch to the next set (cannot play automotically)
- responsive
- a sound when the timer ends
- a minimalist design
- progress bar

## Future Implementations

- (maybe on this repository or another one) create the app using React Native
