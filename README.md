## About

This is the first version of the pomodoro I am trying to create. It is based on the frontend mentor challenge. I decided to use SASS with react to practice using it on my apps.

## Features

- can set the time for pomodoro, short break and long break
- when timer reaches zero, switch to the next set (cannot play automotically)
- responsive

## Future Implementations

- add a sound when the timer starts and ends
- change all the design for have something similar to my taste (I like the frontend mentor design but I want something more simple)
- add animation
- possibility to change the font and color

- (maybe on this repository or another one) create the app using React Native
